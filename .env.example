# ===== RENDER DEPLOYMENT STEPS =====

# 1. Fork the repository with new code
# 2. In Render Dashboard:
#    - Create new Web Service
#    - Connect your GitHub repo
#    - Add environment variables above
#    - Deploy!

# 3. After first deploy, check logs for:
#    "Please enter your phone number:"
#    - Go to Render Shell/Console
#    - Enter your phone number: +1234567890
#    - Enter SMS code when prompted
#    - Copy the session string from logs

# 4. Add TELEGRAM_STRING_SESSION to environment variables
# 5. Redeploy - now large files will work!

# ===== TESTING =====
# Health check: https://your-app.onrender.com/health
# Should show: "telegram_client": true

# ===== TROUBLESHOOTING =====
# If "telegram_client": false:
# - Check API_ID and API_HASH are correct
# - Make sure session string is complete
# - Try re-authentication

# If videos still don't play:
# - Verify files are >20MB (otherwise bot API works)
# - Check IMDB IDs in channel posts
# - Look at Render logs for streaming errors
